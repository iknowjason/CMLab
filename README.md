# Configuration Management (CM) Lab

## Overview

Configuration Management (CM) Lab is a terraform template creating a small enterprise Security lab to practice automation for security and configuration management tooling.  It automatically builds the following resources hosted in AWS:

* Two Ubuntu Linux 22.04 Servers
* Two Windows Server 2022
* CM tools automatically deployed: Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Saltstack, DSCv2, DSCv3
* Nice setup on Windows Servers with OpenSSH and remote SSH access using Powershell 5.1
* **Ansible Content and Labs** with automated terraform infrastructure and configuration deployed for ansible host control
* Multiple Options for Configuration:
  - One Linux Master Server controlling one Linux client and two Windows clients
  - One Windows Server pulling its configuration from another DSC Windows Server
  - Flexibility to remove any of the systems, to just focus on one scenario (One Linux Master, one Windows client)
* Ansible Labs:
  - Ansible Cheat Sheet for commands pre-built.  Pre-configured Ansible infrastructure setup and inventory files host communication.
  - DFIR Live Response Ansible Playbook
  - Windows CIS Hardening Ansible Playbook
  - Ansible setup for Linux SSH, Windows WinRM, and Windows Powershell over SSH
  
## Requirements and Setup

**Tested with:**

* Mac OS 13.4
* terraform 1.5.7

**Clone this repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/iknowjason/CMLab
```

**Credentials Setup:**

Generate an IAM programmatic access key that has permissions to build resources in your AWS account.  Setup your .env to load these environment variables.  You can also use the direnv tool to hook into your shell and populate the .envrc.  Should look something like this in your .env or .envrc:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="VALUE"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="VALUE"
```

## Build and Destroy Resources

### Run terraform init
Change into the AutomatedEmulation working directory and type:

```
terraform init
```

### Run terraform plan or apply
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
or
```
terraform plan -out=run.plan
terraform apply run.plan
```

### Destroy resources
```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### View terraform created resources
The lab has been created with important terraform outputs showing services, endpoints, IP addresses, and credentials.  To view them:
```

```

## Features and Capabilities

### Linux Systems

* **linux1:**  The CM master server (Ubuntu 22.04).  Configuration is controlled in ```linux1.tf```.  Bootstrap script is ```files/linux/ubuntu1.sh.tpl```.  This is the Master server that can automate managing linux2, win1, and win2.
  
  -Software:  Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Saltstack, DSCv3
* **linux2:**  The CM client server (Ubuntu 22.04).  Configuration is controlled in ```linux2.tf```.  Bootstrap script is ```files/linux/ubuntu2.sh.tpl```.  This is the client server that is intended to receive configuration management changes from the linux1 server.
  
  -Software:  Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Saltstack, DSCv2.
  
  -Adds an ```ansible``` username for SSH Ansible authentication

**Remote Access:**  You can SSH into each system.  To get the remote IP, type ```terraform output``` and look for this as an example, either linux1 or linux2:

```
SSH to linux1
---------------
ssh -i ssh_key.pem ubuntu@3.145.146.86
```


### Windows Systems

* **win1:**  The CM client server running Windows Server 2022.  Configuration is controlled in ```win1.tf```.  Bootstrap script is ```files/windows/bootstrap-win1.ps1.tpl```.  This is the Windows server that is configured by the linux1 master CM.  But it can also be used for DSCv2 testing.  The win1 system can be the push/pull server.
  
  -Software:  Chef, Puppet, Powershell Core 7.4, VSCode, OpenSSH
  
  -Adds an ```ansible``` username for WinRM and SSH authentication using Ansible
  
  -Remote Access:  SSH, WinRM, RDP
  
* **win2:**  The CM client server running Windows Server 2022.  Configuration is controlled in ```win2.tf```.  Bootstrap script is ```files/windows/bootstrap-win1.ps2.tpl```.  This is the Windows server that is configured by the linux1 master CM.  But it can also be used for DSCv2 testing.  The win2 system can be the push/pull server.
  
  -Software:  Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Saltstack, DSCv2.
  
  -Adds an ```ansible``` username for WinRM and SSH authentication using Ansible
  
  -Remote Access:  SSH, WinRM, RDP

**Remote Access:**
There is a very nice OpenSSH automated configuration that allows inbound SSH access into each Windows system with a default shell of Windows Powershell 5.1.

To find the SSH or RDP Remote Acess configuration, type ```terraform output``` and look for the following in the output:

```
-------------------------
Virtual Machine win2
-------------------------
Instance ID: i-03b5597cd92d219a7
Computer Name:  win2
Private IP: 10.100.20.149
Public IP:  13.59.251.113
local Admin:  RTCAdmin
local password: Proud-lion-2024!
Ansible User:  ansible
Ansible Pass:  Brave-monkey-2024!

-------------
SSH to win2
-------------
ssh RTCAdmin@13.59.251.113
```


### Deployment Options

Since there are four systems built, feel free to scale this back to only include the systems you want.  You can simply delete the linux1.tf, linux.tf, win1.tf, or win2.tf.  Below are some options:

**Option 1:**  Run linux1 with linux2 to only practice configuration management with Linux.  Delete win1.tf and win2.tf.

**Option 2:**  Run linux1 with win1, to practice having a Linux master configure a Windows client system.  Delete linux2.tf and win2.tf.

**Option 2:**  Test native DSCv2 on Windows by only running win1 and win2.  Delete the linux1.tf and linux2.tf terraform files.

### Important Firewall and White Listing
By default when you run terraform apply, your public IPv4 address is determined via a query to ifconfig.so and the ```terraform.tfstate``` is updated automatically.  If your location changes, simply run ```terraform apply``` to update the security groups with your new public IPv4 address.  If ifconfig.me returns a public IPv6 address,  your terraform will break.  In that case you'll have to customize the white list.  To change the white list for custom rules, update this variable in ```sg.tf```:
```
locals {
  src_ip = "${chomp(data.http.firewall_allowed.response_body)}/32"
  #src_ip = "0.0.0.0/0"
}
```

## Customizing Ansible Playbooks
To add any Ansible playbooks, add any files to the ```files/linux/ansible/``` directory.  This directory is used to create a zip archive by terraform, uploaded to an S3 bucket, and then the Linux1 Master host downloads it from the S3 staging bucket.  This is a good location to update files into.  There is also a templatefiles directory in ```files/linux/templatefiles```. It stores all of the ansible template files that need rendered terraform variables for configuration dynamically built, such as host IP addresses or ansible credentials.
