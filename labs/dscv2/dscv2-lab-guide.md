# DSCv2 Configuration Management

## Introduction
Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a PowerShell-based configuration management system developed by Microsoft. It allows you to define and enforce the desired state of a system by declaring the configuration as code. DSC version 2 (DSCv2) is an enhanced version of the original DSC that provides improved performance, scalability, and additional features.
This lab guide will walk you through three DSC lab examples using two Windows systems.  

## Lab Environment
Your lab environment consists of two Linux systems:

- DSC server (win1)
- DSC client (win2)

## Lab 1:  DSC on single system
In this quick lab, we will build a desired state configuration on one system  (win1) and make the DSC changes locally.

1. RDP into the **win1** system using the credentials and public IP address from ```terraform output```.  Use the local Administrator username and password.  After you RDP in, navigate the following file and make sure that the system has finished bootstrapping:
   ```bash
   C:\terraform\user_data.log
   ```

   When the system has finished bootstrapping, you will see this line:
   ```bash
   End of bootstrap powershell script
   ```

   Do a quick ping test from win1 to win2.  Open up a cmd or pwsh prompt and type:
   ```
   ping win2
   ```

   You should see name resolution working, but firewall will block ping.  This is important, because the host entries are added to the Windows hosts file that are important to all of the labs, allowing name resolution between win1 and win2 systems.

1. Write the configuration script in Powershell.  Open up **Windows Powershell ISE** and **Run as Administrator** by right clicking on the GUI.  Once the application has opened, select **File** in the menu followed by **New**.

   Copy and paste the following powershell into the top code editor area:
   
   ```bash
   Configuration AuditPolicyConfig {
     Node "win1" {
         Registry LogonAudit {
            Key = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Audit\AuditPolicy\Subsystem"
            ValueName = "Logon"
            ValueType = "Dword"
            ValueData = "3"
            Ensure = "Present"
         }
         Registry ObjectAccessAudit {
            Key = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Audit\AuditPolicy\Subsystem"
            ValueName = "File System"
            ValueType = "Dword"
            ValueData = "3"
            Ensure = "Present"
         }
         Registry ProcessCreationAudit {
            Key = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa"
            ValueName = "AuditProcessCreation"
            ValueType = "Dword"
            ValueData = "1"
            Ensure = "Present"
         }
      }
   }
   AuditPolicyConfig -OutputPath "C:\DSC"
   ```

   Save the file using Powershell ISE as:
   ```bash
   AuditPolicyConfig.ps1
   ```

2. Generate the MOF file.  Run the configuration script you just created to generate the MOF file.  You can run this using Powershell ISE by the blue powershell session that is below.  You might need to change into the default directory where the file was saved.
   
   Run the script:
   ```bash
   .\AuditPolicyConfig.ps1
   ```

   This will create a ```win1.mof``` file in the ```C:\DSC``` directory and you should see output showing this artifact.  Nice job.  In the script you should see that the targetNode is listed as "win1".  When you use DSC, the target node name must match in order for DSC to apply the changes.

3. Apply the MOF file on the Target Node (win1).  You can now apply the MOF file to the target node using the powershell command:

   ```bash
   Start-DscConfiguration -Path "C:\DSC" -Wait -Verbose
   ```

   If you receive an error of **Access Denied**, this means you didnt' start Powershell with **Run as Administrator**.  If so, open up a new Powershell session and **Run as Administrator**.  Change into the directory where you saved the file and run the script again.

   YOu should see this output in the beginning and be able to track each of the three changes being applied by the Local Configuration Manager in the script:
   ```
   VERBOSE: Perform operation 'Invoke CimMethod' with following parameters, ''methodName' =                                SendConfigurationApply,'className' =    MSFT_DSCLocalConfigurationManager,'namespaceName' =                                root/Microsoft/Windows/DesiredStateConfiguration'.
   ```

   At the end of the run, you should  see similar to:
   ```
   VERBOSE: Operation 'Invoke CimMethod' complete.
   VERBOSE: Time taken for configuration job to complete is 4.007 seconds
   ```

   Nice work!  You have successfully created and applied a local DSC configuration to win1.
   

## Lab 2:  DSC push between systems
In this quick lab, you will push DSC changes from **win1** to **win2**.  This is a more common use case for development and debugging.  Not production, where you will use a DSC pull from a DSC server in the next lab.  Let's dive in.

1. On **win1**, ensure that you have already successfully completed lab 1.

2. RDP into **win2** which will be the DSC client receiving the push from **win1**.  Follow the previous instructions for RDP by looking at the output from ```terraform output``` and ensure that you use the local Administrator account.

3. Open up a ```Windows Powershell``` session and **Run as Administrator**.  Configure ```win2``` to accept DSC configurations by setting the LCM (Local Configuration Manager) mode to ApplyAndAutoCorrect or ApplyAndMonitor.  This can be done with the following command which can be copy and pasted into the powershell session:
   ```bash
   [DSCLocalConfigurationManager()] 
   configuration LCMConfig { 
	   Node "Win2" { 
		   Settings { 
			   RefreshMode = "Push" 
			   ConfigurationMode = "ApplyAndAutoCorrect" 
		   } 
	   } 
   } 
   LCMConfig -OutputPath "C:\DSC\LCMConfig" 
   Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager -Path "C:\DSC\LCMConfig"
   ```

   In the output area, you will see a directory of ``` Directory: C:\DSC\LCMConfig``` with a filename created of ```win2.meta.mof```.  Nice job.  The LCM on win2 is now ready to accept DSC configurations as **Push** from remote, authenticated sessions.

4. Generate and prepare the MOF file on **win1**.  Back on the **win1** RDP session, look at the previous lab file you had created, named ```win1.mof```.  YOu need to have a file in the ```C:\DSC``` directory called ```win2.mof``` that will be pushed to the remote system.  To do this, you have two options.  You can simply rename the previous file from ```win1.mof``` to ```win2.mof```.  Or you can change the Targetnode parameter in the script to be ```win2``` and run ```.\AuditPolicyConfig.ps1``` once again.  It will generate ```win2.mof```.  To make this easy, let's just rename ```win1.mof``` to be ```win2.mof```:
   
   ```bash
   Rename-Item -Path "C:\DSC\win1.mof" -NewName "Win2.mof"
   ```

5. Push the configuration from **win1** to **win2**.  Use the ```Start-DscConfiguration``` powershell cmdlet on **win1** to push the configuration to **win2**.  In the command, you pass a **ComputerName** parameter to specify that the configuration should be applied to the remote computer ```win2```.

   ```bash
   Start-DscConfiguration -Path "C:\DSC" -ComputerName "Win2" -Wait -Verbose
   ```

   You are able to track the output and see the configuration changes applied to the remote system with the ```-Verbose``` flag.  You now should have gained some knowledge on how to push DSC configurations to remote systems.  Nice job.  In the next section, we will setup a pull configuration and practice a lab with a more common production use case.
   

## Lab 3:  DSC pull between systems
In this next section, you will configure ```win1``` to be a pull server and set up ```win2``` to fetch and apply configuration changes from the pull server.  

1. Install the DSC Service Feature.  This is a Windows feature that needs to be insalled on ```win1```.

   ```bash
   Install-WindowsFeature -Name DSC-Service -IncludeManagementTools
   ```

   Install the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration module from the Powershell Gallery and follow the yes prompts to install it:
   ```
   ï»¿Install-Module -Name xPSDesiredStateConfiguration -Repository PSGallery -Force
   ```

2. Next, configure the DSC pull server on ```win1```.  Create a new powershell script to set up this service.  This script sets up two endpoints:  One for pulling configurations (PSDSCPullServer) and another for compliance reporting (PSDSCComplianceServer).  The pull server listens on port 8080 and is set to use unencrypted traffic by default (only for testing purposes):
   ```bash
   Configuration DSC_PullServer {
   	param (
   		[string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',
        	[string]$certificateThumbprint = 'AllowUnencryptedTraffic'
    	)

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xPSDesiredStateConfiguration

    Node $NodeName {
        WindowsFeature DSCServiceFeature {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Name   = 'DSC-Service'
        }

        xDscWebService PSDSCPullServer {
            Ensure                  = 'Present'
            EndpointName            = 'PSDSCPullServer'
            Port                    = 8080
            PhysicalPath            = "$env:SystemDrive\inetpub\wwwroot\PSDSCPullServer"
            CertificateThumbprint   = $certificateThumbprint
            ModulePath              = "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Modules"
            ConfigurationPath       = "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration"
            State                   = 'Started'
            UseSecurityBestPractices = $false
            DependsOn               = '[WindowsFeature]DSCServiceFeature'
        }

        xDscWebService PSDSCComplianceServer {
            Ensure                  = 'Present'
            EndpointName            = 'PSDSCComplianceServer'
            Port                    = 8081
            PhysicalPath            = "$env:SystemDrive\inetpub\wwwroot\PSDSCComplianceServer"
            CertificateThumbprint   = $certificateThumbprint
            State                   = 'Started'
            UseSecurityBestPractices = $false
            DependsOn               = '[xDscWebService]PSDSCPullServer'
        }
     }
   }
   DSC_PullServer -OutputPath "C:\DSC\PullServer"

   Start-DscConfiguration -Path "C:\DSC\PullServer" -Wait -Verbose
   ```

   3. Now you need to generate the DSC Configurations that will be pulled from ```win1```.  In the previous lab 1, you had already generated a MOF file.  Copy the generated ```win2.mof``` to the Pull Server's configuration path:

      ```bash
      Copy-Item -Path "C:\DSC\Configurations\win2.mof" -Destination "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration"
      ```

      Generate a checksum for the MOF file:
      ```bash
      New-DscChecksum -ConfigurationPath "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration" -Force
      ```
