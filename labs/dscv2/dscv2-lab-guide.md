## Introduction
This lab guide will walk you through setting up a Saltstack environment and performing configuration management tasks between a Linux Salt master and a salt minion running on linux.  You will install and configure a Salt Stack master on a Linux server and a Salt minion on another Linux server. You will then apply a configuration change using Salt to install and configure auditd on the minion.

## Lab Environment
Your lab environment consists of two Linux systems:

- Salt master (linux1)
- Salt minion (linux2)

## Lab 1:  DSC on single system

## Lab 2:  DSC push between systems

## Lab 3:  DSC pull between systems
