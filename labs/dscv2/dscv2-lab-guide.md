# DSCv2 Configuration Management

## Introduction
Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a PowerShell-based configuration management system developed by Microsoft. It allows you to define and enforce the desired state of a system by declaring the configuration as code. DSC version 2 (DSCv2) is an enhanced version of the original DSC that provides improved performance, scalability, and additional features.
This lab guide will walk you through three DSC labs using two Windows systems.
